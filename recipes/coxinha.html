    <h2>Coxinha is a popular food in Brazil consisting of chopped or shredded chicken meat, covered in dough, molded into a shape resembling a drumstick, battered and fried.</h2>
    <p>In the book Stories & Recipes, Nadir Cavazin says that the son of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846-1921) and Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, a child who lived in seclusion for having mental problems, had a favorite dish, chicken, but only ate the drumstick. One day, not having enough drumsticks, the cook decided to turn a whole chicken into drumsticks, shredding it and making the filling for a flour dough shaped into a drumstick. The child endorsed the results. Empress Teresa Cristina, when she was visiting him, could not resist the tasty delicacy; she liked it so much she requested that the master of the imperial kitchen learn how to prepare the snack.</p>
    <p>Different variations of the original are becoming more prevalent today – for example, the coxinha mineira, for which the filling includes maize, so named because maize is deemed a culinary tradition in the state of Minas Gerais, as well as areas where the caipira and sertanejo dialects are spoken. Cheese coxinhas are also very common in snack bars.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 small skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>5 chopped green olives, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pastry:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Breading:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken breasts and 1 cup chicken broth in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Keep checking that there is enough liquid in the pot and add more broth if necessary. Remove chicken from pot, allow to cool briefly, and shred with 2 forks.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, olives, and parsley. Stir well and season with salt and pepper. Remove filling from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 cups chicken broth and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; season with salt and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and stir to form a thick paste. Stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth and no longer sticks to the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and let pastry cool.</li>
        <li>Once pastry is cool enough to handle, transfer to an oiled work surface and knead until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take a portion of pastry and roll into a golf ball-sized ball. Stick an oiled finger into the center of the ball and press the edges to create a small bowl. Stuff with 2 teaspoons of chicken filling and gather the top edges to seal, rolling into a teardrop shape. Set croquette aside and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.</li>
        <li>Set out 3 bowls in the following order: flour, beaten eggs, bread crumbs. Roll each croquette in flour, then dip in egg, then cover in breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a large saucepan or deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the croquettes in batches, until golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
