    <h2>A brigadeiro is generally shaped into small balls covered in chocolate sprinkles and placed in a small cupcake liner.</h2>

    <p>The brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian dessert. The origin of the dessert is uncertain, but the most common theory is that is was created by a confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloisa Nabuco de Oliveira, to promote the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Gomes.</p>

    <p>In recent years, flavor and coating variations on the traditional chocolate brigadeiros have become popular.This variation of flavors and easy manipulation of the original dessert lead into a trend of different recipes, such as cakes, tarts, ice cream or even bread.</p>
